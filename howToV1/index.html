    <h1 class="header">Intro to web dev</h1>
    <p class="text center bold">+ a kickstarter project</p>
    <p class="text">
      As the title involves, this article represents an introduction to web
      development. We will see very briefly how the web works and we will get a
      bit familiar with the main technologies of the web (namely HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript). Finally, after 'getting our feet wet' a bit, and
      understanding how everything works, we will build a little project
      together.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      This project will be a nice warm-up for future projects, and it will help
      you get familiar with how a JavaScript application is built, without any
      framework. This will help you regardless of which framework you will use
      (as you will build something using the full power of JavaScript, power on
      which all the hot frameworks now and I mean React, Angular or VueJS are
      built).
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">How the web works.</p>
    <p class="text">
      The web is like a huge network (it reaches all over the world, and anyone
      can 'talk' to anyone via this network).However, the main logic behind a
      webpage is pretty simple, the user (that's you) also called the 'client'
      makes an <span class="snippet">http request</span> to a webserver. The
      webserver, answers the request, with the required content (let's say a
      webpage):
    </p>
    <div class="devPic">
      <img src="./img/request.jpg" alt="" />
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      Of course there are many types of content we can request from a server (we
      can have a simple webpage but also a video, a game, etc...) and we will
      not dive deep into this for now. We can also have multiple types of
      <span class="snippet">HTTP Requests</span> like:
      <span class="snippet">GET</span>, <span class="snippet">POST</span>,
      <span class="snippet">PUT</span>, <span class="snippet">PATCH</span>,
      <span class="snippet">DELETE</span>. Feel free to read about them, but I
      think for this introductory article, we do not need to look at them in
      detail.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      This article is meant for those who have never wrote a line of code, and
      who will still, be able to build a nice application by reading it. For
      those of you who have prior experience, feel free to just skip below to
      building the application as you will definitely learn something new from
      it.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">HTML, CSS, JS basics</p>
    <p class="text">
      Before we start building the application, you need to understand how these
      3 technologies work. They are the foundational blocks of the web, every web
      application you have seen and you will see, is build with them.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">HTML</p>
    <p class="text">
      HTML stands for <span class="snippet">HyperText Markup Language</span>. Remember, it is a 
      markup language not a programming one (so it can represent content but it does not 'do'
      anything/it has no logic/ it is NOT a programming language).
      HTML defines the meaning and structure of web content. It uses tags for
      defining blocks of content. Some examples of tags would be a header (
      <span class="snippet">h1</span> ) or a paragraph (
      <span class="snippet">p</span> ).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Usually tags come in pairs (an opening and a closing one so
      <span class="snippet"> &lt;p&gt; text here...&lt;/p&gt;</span> but there
      can also be self closing tags like &lt;img src="sample.jpg" alt="sample
      pic" /&gt;).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Note that beside the opening and closing tags, an HTML element can also
      have attributes, which are properties that further configure the element
      (specifying the source for the image like the
      <span class="snippet">src</span> attribute, or a description of the image
      like the <span class="snippet">alt</span> attribute, an attribute which is
      very important for SEO and accessibility).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      For a better understanding, let's create quickly a basic webpage with
      some text on it. Copy the below code and paste it in a
      <span class="snippet">index.html</span> file. Ignore the unknown tags or attributes for now,
      little by little you will learn about all of them.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;

      initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;

  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;This is my first webpage&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am very excited to further develop it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      Open the page you just created in a browser and you will see some plain
      looking, simple page:
    </p>
    <div class="devPic">
      <img src="./img/html.png" alt="" />
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      * Note how the <span class="snippet">title</span> tag is reflected in the title
      of the browser tab.
    </p>
    <p class="text bold center">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</p>
    <p class="text">
      In order to make our little webpage look better, let's add some
      <span class="snippet">CSS</span> to it. CSS stands for Cascading Style
      Sheets. This means that the 'styles' we set with our CSS code, are applied
      from top to bottom in a cascading way. The same can be said about CSS
      links.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      CSS has no logic behind it but it is basically a language that describes
      the presentation of an HTML page.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      In order to add CSS to our document, we can use a
      <span class="snippet">link</span> such as <span class="snippet">
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="myStyle.css" /&gt;</span>, an inline
      <span class="snippet">style tag</span> attribute such as
      <span class="snippet"
        >&lt;p style="color:red;"&gt;my red text here..&lt;/p&gt;</span
      >
      or a <span class="snippet"> &lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt;</span> tag. For
      this basic demo, we will use a style tag so add it as per below:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
  &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
      &lt;meta 
        name="viewport" 
        content="width=device-width, 
        initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;My first wepbage&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;style&gt;
        /* css rules here */
      &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;This is my first webpage&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I am very excited to further develop it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
          </pre

    CSS can "style" elements by selecting them. Let's say we want to select a paragraph and 
    apply some styles to it. This is how you select a paragraph with css:

  <p class="text">
    Note how the styles changed with a single CSS rule for the paragraph. 
    However, our approach is not ideal. The reason for this is that usually css
    rules complexity gets out of control if we are not careful. In order for the
    complexity to be kept under control (and for the rules not to conflict with each other)
    we need the CSS rules to be as specific as possible. We can increase the specificity by moving
     the rule we wrote inside a class.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    We do this by changing the rule (specifying that it applies to a class instead of a paragraph selector):

        <p class="text center bold">JavaScript</p>
        <p class="text">
          JavaScript is a highly interactiv, dynamic, programming language. It can add logic to our webpage.
          It can make it 'do' and 'remember' stuff and add interactivity to it. 
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          I will not do a generic introduction to JavaScript, as this is not the place for it, I will just show you how to add JavaScript
          to your webpage and then, we will move on to building the application.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          In order to add JavaScript to a page, we have to use a <span class="snippet">&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span> tag.
          The script tag can reference a file, like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
          &lt;script src="myScript.js" &gt; &lt;/script&gt;
        </pre>
        <p class="text">
          In the case above, the JavaScript code is inside the <span class="snippet">myScript.js</span> file. However,
          we can also have the JavaScript code directly in the script tag:
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
          &lt;script&gt; 
            //code that does stuff here
          &lt;/script&gt;
        </pre>
        <p class="text">
          For our introductory demo, we will use the latter approach and write the code directly inside the 
          script tag. 
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Start by adding a script tag and an input field in the webpage:

    Now whatever you type in the field will get put in the green header.

  <p class="text">
    This is how you 'connect'  <span class="snippet">HTML</span> code with a <span class="snippet">CSS</span>
    and <span class="snippet">JavaScript</span>. These three technologies together, can do many
    awesome things and you will love to use them. 
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    If you never wrote a line of code, I bet you feel a bit like a wizzard now. At least
    that's how I felt when I first connected some HTML code with a CSS file and a JavaScript one.

  <p class="text center bold">
    Building a real application
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Now, that we have 'got our feet wet' and we know how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together, we can try to 
    put together a little project. This will be an introductory project, and it will represent a nice transition towards
    more advanced full-stack applications that we will build in the future. We will build a note taking application.
    The application will only have a client (a 'front page' doing all the logic for us). There will be no server (to store data for us
    or to import/export data, filter it and do other 'back-end' related stuff). However, the applicaiton will be able
    to do many things and it will sort of 'mimmick' a real backend.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Here's a link of a live deployment of the application, so you can see what we will build and what it will look like:
    <a target="_blank" href="https://silly-mirzakhani-1db863.netlify.app/">Link to app</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Test the application a bit before starting, so you get familiar with how it works and what you will be building. Try adding
    some notes, edit them, delete some and add them back, etc...
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Try exporting your notes, delete all the notes and import them back. The import functionality is set so that it appends
    the imported notes to the existing ones (so if you import without deleting the current notes, you will simply get the ones imported
    added to your current ones).
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Once you get used to the application, we can start building it. It will be a single page application, it will serve all the contents
    in an <span class="snippet">index.html</span> file and all the contents there (the routing from one page/section) to the next, will be 
    performed dynamically, with JavaScript by adding and removing/hiding stuff from the <span class="snippet">DOM</span>. For those of you 
    who are complete beginners, I will not be able to do a full introduction on the Document Object Model (that's the DOM), but just remember
    that it is a tree-like representation of the webpage, in which all elements of a page are branches of a tree. It looks like this:
  </p>
  <div class="devPic"> 
    <img src="./img/dom.jpg" alt="DOM tree representation" />
  </div>
  <p class="text">
    So as for the structure of our application, we will have an <span class="snippet">index.html</span> file, a <span class="snippet">css</span>
    file and two <span class="snippet">JavaScript</span> files. The two JavaScript files are handling the UI (user interface) and the notes processing.
    So one will do the notes and the other one will do the interface manipulation (and there will be quite a bit of code in there).
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Start by creating a folder (I named mine project) and create an <span class="snippet">index.html</span> file in it. Inside the .html file, add the below code:
  </p>
  </body>

</html>
