    <h1 class="header">Intro to web dev</h1>
    <p class="text center bold">+ a kickstarter project</p>
    <p class="text">
      As the title involves, this article represents an introduction to web
      development. We will see very briefly how the web works and we will get a
      bit familiar with the main technologies of the web (namely HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript). Finally, after 'getting our feet wet' a bit, and
      understanding how everything works, we will build a little project
      together.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      This project will be a nice warm-up for future projects, and it will help
      you get familiar with how a JavaScript application is built, without any
      framework. This will help you regardless of which framework you will use
      (as you will build something using the full power of JavaScript, power on
      which all the hot frameworks now and I mean React, Angular or VueJS are
      built).
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">How the web works.</p>
    <p class="text">
      The web is like a huge network (it reaches all over the world, and anyone
      can 'talk' to anyone via this network).However, the main logic behind a
      webpage is pretty simple, the user (that's you) also called the 'client'
      makes an <span class="snippet">http request</span> to a webserver. The
      webserver, answers the request, with the required content (let's say a
      webpage):
    </p>
    <div class="devPic">
      <img src="./img/request.jpg" alt="" />
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      Of course there are many types of content we can request from a server (we
      can have a simple webpage but also a video, a game, etc...) and we will
      not dive deep into this for now. We can also have multiple types of
      <span class="snippet">HTTP Requests</span> like:
      <span class="snippet">GET</span>, <span class="snippet">POST</span>,
      <span class="snippet">PUT</span>, <span class="snippet">PATCH</span>,
      <span class="snippet">DELETE</span>. Feel free to read onto them, but I
      think for this introductory article, we do not need to look at them in
      detail.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      This article is meant for those who have never wrote a line of code, and
      who will still, be able to build a nice application by reading it. For
      those of you who have prior experience, feel free to just skip below to
      building the application as you will definitely learn something new from
      it.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">HTML, CSS, JS basics</p>
    <p class="text">
      Before we start building the application, you need to understand how these
      3 technologies work. They are the foundational blocks of the web, every
      application you have seen and you will see, is build with them.
    </p>
    <p class="text center bold">HTML</p>
    <p class="text">
      HTML stands for <span class="snippet">HyperText Markup Language</span>.
      HTML defines the meaning and structure of web content. It uses tags for
      defining blocks of content. Some examples of tags would be a header (
      <span class="snippet">h1</span> ) or a paragraph (
      <span class="snippet">p</span> ).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Usually tags come in pairs (an opening and a closing one so
      <span class="snippet"> &lt;p&gt; text here...&lt;/p&gt;</span> but there
      can also be self closing tags like &lt;img src="sample.jpg" alt="sample
      pic" /&gt;).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Note that beside the opening and closing tags, an HTML element can also
      have attributes, which are properties that further configure the element
      (specifying the source for the image like the
      <span class="snippet">src</span> attribute, or a description of the image
      like the <span class="snippet">alt</span> attribute, an attribute which is
      very important for SEO and accessibility).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      For a better understanding, let's create quickly a basic webpage with
      some text on it. Copy the below code and paste it in a
      <span class="snippet">index.html</span> file. Ignore the unknown tags or attributes for now,
      little by little you will learn about all of them.
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
    &lt;meta 
      name="viewport" 
      content="width=device-width, 
      initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My first wepbage&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;This is my first webpage&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am very excited to further develop it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>
    <p class="text">
      Open the page you just created in a browser and you will see some plain
      looking, simple page:
    </p>
    <div class="devPic">
      <img src="./img/html.png" alt="" />
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      * Note how the <span class="snippet">title</span> tag is reflected in the title
      of the browser tab.
    </p>
    <p class="text bold center">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</p>
    <p class="text">
      In order to make our little webpage look better, let's add some
      <span class="snippet">CSS</span> to it. CSS stands for Cascading Style
      Sheets. This means that the 'styles' we set with our CSS code, are applied
      from top to bottom in a cascading way. The same can be said about CSS
      links.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      CSS has no logic behind it but it is basically a language that describes
      the presentation of an HTML page.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      In order to add CSS to our document, we can use a
      <span class="snippet">link</span>, an inline
      <span class="snippet">style tag</span> attribute such as
      <span class="snippet"
        >&lt;p style="color:red;"&gt;my red text here..&lt;/p&gt;</span
      >
      or a <span class="snippet"> &lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt;</span> tag. For
      this basic presentation, we will use a style tag so add it as per below:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
  &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
      &lt;meta 
        name="viewport" 
        content="width=device-width, 
        initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;My first wepbage&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;style&gt;
        /* css rules here */
      &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;This is my first webpage&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I am very excited to further develop it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
          </pre
    >
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    CSS can "style" elements by selecting them. Let's say we want to select a paragraph and 
    apply some styles to it. This is how you select a paragraph with css:

      p {
        display: block;
        margin: auto;
        font-size: 2rem;
        background: blue;
        border: 5px solid #ccc;
        color: #fff;
        text-align: center;
        width: 30rem;
        padding: 1rem;
        border-radius: 15px;
      }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;This is my first webpage&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I am very excited to further 
        develop it.

  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

  <p class="text">
    Note how the styles changed with a single CSS rule for the paragraph. 
    However, our approach is not ideal. The reason for this is that usually css
    rules complexity gets out of control if we are not careful. In order for the
    complexity to be kept under control (and for the rules not to conflict with eachother)
    we need the CSS rules to be as specific as possible.
